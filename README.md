## Go Language Learning Repository

Welcome! This repository is a personal journey through the foundations of the Go programming language, organized for easy exploration.

### Project Structure

```

	01_Basics/
		main.go                # Basic syntax and Hello World
	02_Constants_and_Types/
		main.go                # Constants, types, and variables
	03_Control_Structures/
		main.go                # If, for, switch, etc.
	04_Functions/
		main.go                # Functions and parameters
	05_Slices_and_Arrays/
		main.go                # Slices, arrays, and operations
	06_Maps/

#### Key Highlights

- **Go_Foundations/**: Step-by-step folders for each major Go topic, each with a focused `main.go`.
- **projects/**: Contains practical mini-projects and exercises. This is the best place to review my applied learning and coding style.
- **docs/**: Advice and roadmap for my learning process.

### How to Run

You need [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) (recommended: Go 1.20+).

To run any example:

```bash
cd Go_Foundations/01_Basics
go run main.go
```

Or for a project:

```bash
cd Go_Foundations/projects
go run quiz.go
```
